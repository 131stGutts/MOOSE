# MOOSE framework

MOOSE is a **M**ission **O**bject **O**riented **S**cripting **E**nvironment, and is meant for mission designers and mission hosters.
It allows to quickly setup complex missions using pre-scripted scenarios using the available classes within the MOOSE Framework.
MOOSE works with DCS world 1.5. and 2.0.

## MOOSE Framework Goal

The goal of MOOSE is to allow mission designers to enhance their scripting with mission orchestration objects, which can be instantiated from defined classes within the framework. This will allow to write mission scripts with minimal code embedded. Of course, the richness of the framework will determine the richness of the misson scenarios. 
The MOOSE is a service that is produced while being consumed ... , it will evolve further as more classes are developed for the framework, and as more users are using it.
MOOSE is not a one-man show, it is a collaborative effort and meant to evolve within a growing community around the framework.
Within the community, key users will start supporting, documenting, explaining and even creating new classes for the framework.
It is the ambition to grow this framework as a de-facto standard for mission designers to use.

## Please Donate ...

If you appreciate this development, please support to extend the framework. The development of this framework takes a lot of time.
A small gift would help me to buy a new small laptop that I can use to extend this framework while commuting to and from work ...
Also, your donations will be saved and spent wisely to the advantage of the community! 

If everyone helps with a small amount, it would be really great!
